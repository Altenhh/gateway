# Momiji Gateway

The gateway for Momiji, an upcoming multi-purpose Discord bot for general usage, whether it be game info grabbing or leaderboards. This gateway and API exists as a central for getting, and adding to data stored in a MySQL database to keep functionality with most features.

# Requirements
- >= Node.js v10

# Contributing
The team over at MD appreciates contributions to the code, but it's better to keep it within a PR (Pull Request), with our knowledge and consent over on our discord server.

# Usage
We allow free will and usage over this codebase and application, but support will not be given as it is primarily built for one bot, with one purpose in mind. It's better to merely copy this project to contribute, instead of utilizing the code for a purpose other than what it is made for. Please do not contact any of the team members for setup support, unless contributing is your primary goal.
